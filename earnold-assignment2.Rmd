## Introduction to Data file

I acquired this data from the World Health Organization. I was interested in exploring some epidemic data to see how a disease would compare between regions around the world, and whether that has changed in recent years.

I found a sufficent dataset here http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.617?lang=en

It addresses the HIV/AIDs epidemic, and this particular data covers the number of people (all ages) living with HIV around the world. It includes data from 2000, 2005, 2010, and  2018, across 172 different countries. 

I actually edited the data and added a column for region, so I would be able to see this data more broadly at a regional level as well.

After reading in the data, I needed to clean it up a bit to get it ready for ggplot2.

```{r read in data}
#read in data
hiv.data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Emily/Documents/Data Science/Data Visualization/Assignment 2/HIV.csv")

#need to create a column for year

hiv.data1 <- hiv.data %>% 
  gather(.,key = year, value = people, -Country, -Region)

#minor text edits
hiv.data1$year <- gsub("X", "", hiv.data1$year)
hiv.data1$people <- gsub(" ", "", hiv.data1$people)
hiv.data1$people <- gsub("No data", NA, hiv.data1$people)


#making people numeric
hiv.data1$people <- as.numeric(hiv.data1$people)
hiv.data1$year <- as.factor(hiv.data1$year)

hiv.data1 <- na.omit(hiv.data1)
```

Now that I have this created and cleaned, the question I want to start with is over time, which regions of the world represent the highest HIV positive population?


```{r create visualization}

hiv.data1 %>%
group_by(Region, year) %>% 
summarize(people = sum(people)) %>% 
ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = year, y = people, color = Region))+
   geom_point()+
  scale_y_log10()+
   xlab("Year")+
   ylab("Number of people living with HIV")+
  ggtitle("Number of people living with HIV by year")+
  labs(caption = "Shows the number of people living with HIV broken out by region, over the course of 18 years. Africa shows notably higher numbers than all other regions."
  )
   
```

Based on this first visualization, we can see that Africa has the highest number of cases, which is steadily rising. The Americas come in second, followed by South-East Asia.

I'm curious about the Americas' cases in particular, since this Region spans both North and South America.

I'll group by the Americas and facet by year to see which countries are contributing the most.

```{r create visualization 2}
hiv.data1 %>%
filter(Region == "Americas") %>% 
ggplot(., mapping = aes(x = Country, y = people, color = Country))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = Country))+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  xlab("Country")+
  ylab("Number of people living with HIV")+
  ggtitle("Number of people living with HIV by Country in the Americas", subtitle = "Faceted by Year")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())+
  labs(caption = "Shows the number of people living with HIV broken out by country within the Americas region, over the course of 18 years. Brazil shows notably higher numbers than all other countries")
```

I think the most important takeaways from this visual is that Brazil consistently represents the highest count of HIV cases, except for in 2010 when the USA experienced a notable spike. Digging further into the data, it looks like data from the US is missing for all years shown here except 2010. 

I think this visualization is able to quickly answer the question of which Region contains the most cases of HIV (Africa), and even digs further to see which part of the Americas has the most HIV as well (Brazil, and probably the US).

I think if I were to dig further into this, I would look up the populations of all these countries to get an idea of how bad the epidemic is within the context of a country's population overall.
